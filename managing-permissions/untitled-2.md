# Using the Multi-Sig Lock Script

Multi-sig functionality allows a single cell to be owned and unlocked by multiple users. This is achieved by using the multi-sig lock script. Just like with the Secp256r1 example, any cell can use a multi-sig lock by specifying a multi-sig binary executable in the lock script and providing the correct arguments.
