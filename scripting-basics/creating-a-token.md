# Creating a Token

Tokens are one of the most common use cases for smart contracts today. As of 2021, there are over 400,000 different tokens that have been created on various platforms. In this lesson, we will learn how to create a basic token on Nervos.

To do this we will examine the SUDT standard, which stands for Simple User-Defined Token. SUDT is a minimalistic token standard, and the first official token standard to be released on Nervos. We use a Rust-based implementation that has specifically been formatted to be easier to read. The [official implementation](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-miscellaneous-scripts/blob/master/c/simple_udt.c) is written in C, but reviewing it is purely optional.
