# Lab: Convert IC3Type to OC5Type

Complete the exercise in `entry.rs` in the folder `Lab-OC5Type-Exercise/contracts/oc5type/src` by adding code and values as necessary.

The `entry.rs` file currently reflects the source code for the IC3Type script, which counts the number of input cells available and only succeeds when that count is 3. Your task is to change the functionality of this script to count the number of output cells available, and only succeed when that count is 5 \(OC5Type\).

Build your code by opening a terminal to the `Lab-OC5Type-Exercise` folder and running `capsule build`, then test your code using `capsule test` after the build is successful. If you get stuck you can find the solution in the `Lab-OC5Type-Solution` folder.

Once your code successfully compiles and all tests are passed, you have completed this lab.
